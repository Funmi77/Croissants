<h1>🥐Croissants</h1>   
<p>
A croissant is a buttery, flaky French viennoiserie pastry named for its historical crescent shape, 
made from a laminated yeast-leavened dough. 
It is characterized by a crisp exterior and soft, airy, layered interior achieved 
by folding butter into dough multiple times. Often eaten for breakfast or as a snack, 
they can be plain, filled with chocolate, almond, or cheese.
